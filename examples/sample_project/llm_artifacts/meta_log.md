# Income-Expense Analysis: Meta Log

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyse the relationship between income levels, expense patterns, and financial outcomes. We will explore how different income brackets manage expenses and identify factors that contribute to financial stability.

- [ ] Data acquisition and cleaning
- [ ] Exploratory data analysis
- [ ] Statistical modelling
- [ ] Results interpretation
- [ ] Report generation
- [ ] Manuscript preparation

## Session Summaries

### 2023-07-15: Project Initialization
**Goals**: Set up project structure and plan analysis approach
**Achievements**:
- Created directory structure following recommended organization
- Established meta logging process
- Outlined analysis workflow
- Identified key research questions:
  1. How do expense patterns differ across income brackets?
  2. Which expense categories most strongly predict financial outcomes?
  3. Are there interaction effects between income level and specific expense types?

**Next Steps**:
- Acquire sample income-expense dataset
- Develop data cleaning script
- Begin exploratory visualizations

### 2023-07-16: Data Acquisition
**Goals**: Obtain suitable dataset and begin cleaning process
**Achievements**:
- [To be completed after session]

## Decision Points

### 2023-07-15: Analysis Approach
**Question**: Should we use regression or classification for the primary analysis?
**Decision**: We will use a mixed approach:
1. Regression models to predict continuous financial outcomes
2. Classification to categorize financial stability status
**Rationale**: This allows us to capture both the magnitude of effects and the probability of specific outcomes, providing a more comprehensive analysis.
